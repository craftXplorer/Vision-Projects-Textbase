# Important!

This is the textbase containing important paragraphs on the site https://visionprojects.net/

See this [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) on how to style the pages!

Placeholders: 
- {projects}
- {calendar}

Project pages should be like the [template](project-template.md). Duplicate and fill out everything for new projects. As the file name, use the project's name. When the page is ready for publishing, make an entry for it in [projects.md](projects.md)

The access is limited to official Vision Projects team members.
