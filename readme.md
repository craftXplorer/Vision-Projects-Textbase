# Important!

This is the textbase containing important paragraphs on the site https://visionprojects.net/

See this [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) on how to style the pages!

Project pages should be like the [template](https://github.com/craftXplorer/Vision-Projects-Textbase/blob/main/project-template.md). Duplicate and fill out everything for new projects. As the file name, use the project's name.

The access is limited to official Vision Projects team members.
