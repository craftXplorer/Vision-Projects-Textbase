## About

*FactionFight* was a project in early 2024. It was inspired by the German PvP project "Varo", but with some changes:

1. Orginaly the were **2 players** in one team. In our version there were 4
2. We added some special items to make it more interesting. These were for example a trident summoning lightnings or a potion to elevate.
